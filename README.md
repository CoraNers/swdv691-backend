# Let's Multiply! (Backend)

## Purpose
The purpose of Let's Multiply! is to help students with their multiplication.  They are able to practice all the multiplication facts, they can be evaulated (timed) to see their scores improve, and they can view a history of all facts they've answered, to show them or their parent what facts may need some additional practice.  Learning through gaming!

This project houses the server-side APIs that will be the middle-layer for communicating between the Frontend application and the database layer (MongoDB). There will be APIs to both persist the data to the db as well as for retrieving data for view on the UI.
